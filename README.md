The bar system project is a Java application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing orders, products, and user authentication in a bar setting. The project consists of several classes organized into different packages to encapsulate related functionalities. Let's describe the project in its entirety:

Packages:

com.company: Contains the main class Main that serves as the entry point of the application.
database: Contains the DataProvider class responsible for managing the data of the application, such as users, products, and orders.
models: Contains the data models used in the application, including User, Product, Order, and UserType enum.
Main Class:

Main: Creates an instance of the AdvanceFrame class, which represents the main window of the application, and sets it visible.
User Authentication:

User: Represents a user in the system, storing attributes such as name, code (password), and user type.
UserType: An enum representing the different types of users, including waitresses and managers.
LoginPanel: Displays a login panel where users can enter their code (password) to authenticate themselves.
BasePanel: A base class for other panels, providing common functionality for managing the GUI components.
Order Management:

Order: Represents an order, storing information such as the table number and the list of products in the order.
OrderPanel: Displays the panel for managing orders. Allows users to add products to the order, delete products, and save or cancel the order.
Product Management:

Product: Represents a product in the bar system, storing attributes such as ID, type, brand, quantity, price, and sale price.
TablesPanel: Displays the panel for managing tables. Users can select a table, view the bill for the table, and add products to the table's order.
Bill and GUI Components:

BillPanel: Displays the panel for generating and displaying the bill for an order.
BasePanel: A base class for other panels, providing common functionality for managing the GUI components.
AdvanceFrame: Represents the main window of the application. Manages the switching between different panels and provides the overall GUI for the bar system.
Data Management:

DataProvider: Manages the data of the application, such as loading users, products, and orders. It creates and populates lists of waitresses, products, and orders. It also includes methods for retrieving and manipulating data.

Overall, the bar system project provides a user-friendly GUI for managing orders, products, and user authentication in a bar setting. Users can log in with their codes (passwords), select tables, add products to orders, generate bills, and perform other related actions. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and effective use of GUI components in Java.
